    <h1><center>HTML SEMANTIC ELEMENTS</center></h1>
    <p>The HTML semantics refers to the tags that provide meaning to an HTML page rather than just presentation. It makes HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of webpages. </p>
    <p>The semantic HTML tags help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of webpages.</p>

        <dl>What is HTML Semantics</dl>
        <dd>The core characteristics of a semantic element is that it clearly communicated its meaning to both the developer and the browser. These elements clearly define the its content.</dd>
