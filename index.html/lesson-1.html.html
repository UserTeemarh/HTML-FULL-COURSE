    <h1><center style="
    text-transform: uppercase;">INTRODUCTION TO CODING</center></h1>
    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">WHAT IS CODING?</h2>
   <p><b>Coding</b> creates a set of instruction for computer to follow. These Instructions determine what actions a computer can and cannot take. coding allow programmers to build programs. such as website and apps </p>
   <dt>
    <dl style="font-size: 25px;">HOW DOES CODING WORK</dl>
    <dd>Since Computer do not communicate like humans, Coding  acts as a translator. <mark>Code convert human input into numerical sequences that computers understand.</mark> Binary code is the primary language of all computers, binary code consist of only two numbers: <b>one</b> and <b>zero</b>. In the binary coding language, Zero represents  "off" and "on"</dd>
    <dd>Binary code allows programmers to create a simple instructions and procedure for computers
    </dd>
   </dt>
   <h3>CODING AS LOW-LEVEL vs HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGE</h3>
   <dt>
    <dl style="font-weight: 100;"><mark>Computer programmer</mark> split coding Languages into two groups: Low-level and High-level</dl>
    <dd><ins>Low-level Language:</ins> like binary, are considered "machine-oriented" Machine-oriented languages write instructions that must be specified in terms of the capabilities of the processor in question. Coders also refer to low-level languagee as assembly language or machine code.</dd>
    <dd><ins>High-level Languages</ins>: are user-oriented.Most of the popular coding Languages. Programmers designed High-level language to convert an algorithm into program code more easily, High-level coding language are closer to human language __ they include more nuance and adaptability than low-level coding languages</dd>
   </dt>

    <h3>BENEFITS of LEARNING CODING</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin: 5px; padding: 5px;"><b>Elevate your Career Prospects:</b> Regardless of whether you work in the tech industry, learning at least one programming language can help you stand out from the competition in an interview process or help you negotiate a higher salary</li>
        <li style="margin: 5px; padding: 5px;"><b>Improve your Problem-solving Skills</b>: Many people who learn to code report an improved ability to break problems down into smaller pieces and approach problems with clearer, linear thinking</li>
        <li style="margin: 5px; padding: 5px;"><b>Cultivate Creativity:</b> Coding gives you ability to create anything you can dream of.</li>

    <p>They are also called <b>Text Editors:</b> A Text Editor is a computer program that enables user to create change or edit plain text files. They're often used to craft complex code for websites; read, create and edit source code; or build text files</p>
    <i><center style="position: relative; top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">below are the top 5 leading text editing software.</center></i>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Visual Studio Code:</b> or VSCODE, is a source-code editor created by Microsoft. The software enables users to build code with teammate in real time on Windows, macOS, or Linux. It's equipped with syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging features that enhance the software development process</li>
        <li><b>Sublime Text:</b> is an editor with features such as copy and paste, find and replace, and multi-line editing. If you need to make your code stand out, then it's the best to use because it supports various plugins that help improve functionality. Its user-firendly interface support many programming language. it's one of the most popular text editors available under free-software licences </li>
        <li><b>Notepad++:</b> is a source code editor that can do evrything a simple Notepad does__ only better. It supports almost all coding languages, occupies minimal space on your computer, and boosts the execution speed of the program</li>
