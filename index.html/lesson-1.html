    <h1><center style="
    text-transform: uppercase;"><u>INTRODUCTION TO CODING</u></center></h1>
   <p><b>Coding</b> is the process of transforming ideas, solutions, and instructions into the language that the computer can understand - binary (machine code).</p>
   <p>Coding involves communicating and giving instructions for different actions we want our computers to perform using a computer programming language.</p>
   <h2><u>What is Binary Code?</u></h2>
   <p>Binary code by design corresponds directly with specific machine instructions, commands, and locations in the computer's memory. The computer then reads and interprets these instructions and then carries out particular tasks. It's called binary code because it is made of sequences of <mark>0</mark>s and <mark>1</mark>s.  </p>
   <h2><u>How Does Coding Work?</u></h2>
   <p>Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual</p>
   <p>A programmer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that creates and run a successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions included in coded maunal.</p>
   <p>User interacts with websites and apps with the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show up on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a programmer asks the computer to display.</p>
   <p><mark>Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. <u>programming languages</u> provide the rules to building website, apps, and other computer based technologies, Each programming language helps humans accurately communicate with machines</mark></p>
      
   <h2><center> Programming Language:</center></h2>
   <p>Programming languages are similar to human languages in the sense that they are made up of basic syntactical elements like nouns, verbs, and phrases. Those elements are group together to form something that resembles a sentence to create a meaning.</p>
   <p>These languages actually resemble and look a lot like English. But they offer a shorter, more precise and less verbose way to create instructions that the computer can understand.</p>
   <p><mark>Programming languages are a set of rules that define how you write computer code.
   </mark> The computer code to create web applications, websites, games, operating systems, and other software programs and technologies.</p>
   <h3><u>Types of Programming Languages</u></h3>
   <p><b>Low-level Programming Language:</b> Binary code is known as low-level language because it is the language computer understands. Each digit in a coded sequence connects to a switch, which triggers an action, and together thousands of switches operate a device. <-+++++++/p>
   <p><b>High-level Programming Language</b> A computer communication process that works much like human language, allows programmers to operate entire systems simultaneously. It converts human language from programmers into binary code that computers understand.</p>
   <h4><u>Types of High-level Programming Languages</u></h4>
   <p>Front-end developers typically use HTML, CSS or <u>JavaScript code</u> to create website layouts and design functions.</p>
   <p>Websites with user accounts, requrie back-end developers to write computer code that connects websites to databases. <u>back-end developers</u> often write code using languages like <b>SQL, Java, and Python</b> </p>
   <p>Developers use other languages like <b>Python, C#, Swift, of Ruby on Rails</b> to create apps for cell phones and computer software</p>

   <ul>
    <li><b>HTML:</b> &NonBreakingSpace;Used for creating the structures of a webpage.</li>
    <li><b>CSS:</b>&NonBreakingSpace; Used for decorating and laying out of a webpage</li>
    <li><b>JavaScript:</b>&NonBreakingSpace; Used for creating webpages and supporting Front-end and back-end development</li>
    <li><b>C:</b>  &NonBreakingSpace;Used for developing software operating systems and databases</li>
    <li><b>Python:</b> &NonBreakingSpace;Used for building websites and software programs and performing data analysis</li>
    <li><b>Ruby on Rails:</b>&NonBreakingSpace; Used for developing websites and applications and performing data analysis
    </li>
    <li><b>C++:</b> &NonBreakingSpace;Used for creating and developing games </li>
    <li><b>PHP:</b>&NonBreakingSpace; Used for text manipulation, web development, and network programming</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>SOFTWARES FOR CODING?</h3>
    <p>They are also called <b>Text Editors:</b> A Text Editor is a computer program that enables user to create change or edit plain text files. They're often used to craft complex code for websites; read, create and edit source code; or build text files</p>
    <i><center>below are the top 5 leading text editing software.</center></i>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Visual Studio Code:</b> or VSCODE, is a source-code editor created by Microsoft. The software enables users to build code with teammate in real time on Windows, macOS, or Linux. It's equipped with syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging features that enhance the software development process</li>
        <li><b>Sublime Text:</b> is an editor with features such as copy and paste, find and replace, and multi-line editing. If you need to make your code stand out, then it's the best to use because it supports various plugins that help improve functionality. Its user-firendly interface support many programming language. it's one of the most popular text editors available under free-software licences </li>
        <li><b>Notepad++:</b> is a source code editor that can do everything a simple Notepad does__ only better. It supports almost all coding languages, occupies minimal space on your computer, and boosts the execution speed of the program</li>
        <li><b>Atom:</b> is a free text editor built on electron. Its ability to customize it to quickly accomplish basic and complex assignments makes it stand out</li>
        <li><b>Brackets:</b> Created by Adobe Inc. Brackets is a free, Open-source software code editor primarily focused on web development support. It makes use of javascripts, HTML, and CSS along with visual tools and processor support, to help users design in the browser with ease.</li>
